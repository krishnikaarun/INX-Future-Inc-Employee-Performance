    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The problem is to predict the performance rating of employees in a company based on various attributes such as age, gender, education background, job role, department, work experience, job satisfaction, etc. The goal is to build a machine learning classification model that can accurately predict the performance rating of employees and gain insights into the key factors influencing their performance.\n",

    "### Data Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pre-Processing steps involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Checking for Null values. **There was no Null values**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Checking for Duplicate values. **There was no Duplicate values**\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Checking whether the data is Imbalanced. **The dataset is Imbalanced**\n",
    "        \n",
    "        i) Used SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) we have performed Oversampling as the dataset is small.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n",
    "\n",
    "Conducted an exploratory analysis of the data to understand its distribution, correlations, relationships between variables and Visualize key insights from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Numerical features analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    i) The Age distribution ranges from 18 to 60, but most of the employees are in between the range of 30 to 40 age.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii) Most of the employees lives nearly 0 – 5 Kms or Miles from Office.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iii) Most of the employees work as low-level job in the Organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iv) The organization is mostly considered to be the second company for the Employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "    v) The company has offered minimum of 11% and Maximum of 25%, but most of the employee has received low percentage hike of 11- 14%.\n",
    "\n",
    "    vi) Most likely the employees are staying in this company for about 5 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "    vii) The employees undergo 2 – 3 training in the last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Categorical features Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    i) There are 60% of Male and 40% Female working in this Company.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii) Most of the Employees are from Life Science and Medical Background.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iii) The Employees are mostly Working in Sale, Development, Research and Development Department and Least working Employees are from Data Science Department.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iv) Sale Executive and Developer are the top 2 departments where Employee count is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "    v) Most of the Employee’s work doesn’t involve travelling for work.\n",
    "\n",
    "    vi) Most of the Employee have completed their Bachelor degree.\n",

    "\n",
    "    ii) EducationBackground, DistanceFromHome, TrainingTimesLastYear, BusinessTravelFrequency, OverTime are the features which are negatively correlate with the Perfomance Rating                      \n",
    "\n",
    "    iii) People who have more experience with the company has the more probability to get the promotion from the correlation between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "We have Selected the most relevant features for modeling and remove any redundant or irrelevant ones. Techniques like SelectKBest,Chi Square are used individually for each model we used.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have Choosen appropriate classification algorithms for the task, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Navie Bayes from which best accuracy model will be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Building:\n",
    "We have Implemented the selected machine learning algorithms to create predictive models. Train the models on the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuned the model hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluated the performance of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Training and Evaluation We have tried with different models such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Logistic Regression (Accuracy – 85.01%)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Random Forest Classifier** (Accuracy - **95%**)\n",
